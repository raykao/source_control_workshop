# Markdown

- What is Markdown -> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- "[GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)"

99% of documentation for open source is written in Markdown.  This allows us to have the rich text formatting power of most test editors in a codified manner.  Ultimately Markdown is rendered (transformed) into HTML to view in a browser.  You can also preview how Markdown will be displayed using Markdown viewers, or the the built in feature in VS Code (Open the command Pallette in VS Code and Enter "Markdown".  Open command Pallette: CTRL/CMD + Shift + P).
